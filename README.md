# The "Payman": powered by Symfony

This project has the same core (built with Domain-Driven Design in mind) as https://github.com/vtos/payman. The difference is now it uses Symfony for the infrastructure layer.

The purpose of this repository is to practice Domain-Driven Design methodology, hexagonal architecture (Ports and Adapters), probably some microservices and add a framework to the mix.
